# Twitter Emotion Detection NLP Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for training and deploying a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to detect emotion from sentences in real tweets. The model is trained on a dataset of real tweets labeled with emotions, allowing it to capture the nuances and context-specific characteristics of emotions expressed on Twitter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

```bash
pip install nlp
```

## Dataset

the dataset for this training and for testing are included in the data folder

## Training

To train the NLP model, run the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script will load the dataset, preprocess the text, and train the model using a deep learning architecture. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

This will generate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall etc ...
